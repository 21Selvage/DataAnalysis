This Python program builds a complete machine learning pipeline by generating synthetic data with NumPy, processing it with Pandas, and training a linear regression model using PyTorch.
It includes data splitting, model training with gradient descent, and weight analysis, making it a versatile example of integrating multiple powerful libraries in one project.
